Small project to learn about topics that intrest me.
Pokedex is a project where I use sqlite to make a database where
it contains information on all known Pokemon.

The first part is to use sqlite and C++ to create a database and be able to create a table,
insert, and select. 

The second part is to use Perl (subject to change) to get information from Bulbapedia,
an online wiki of Pokemon, and use that to populate the database.

Lastly, I would like to be able to make it so a user can use the Pokedex to search infromation
on Pokemon they are intrested in by using infromation such as name, type, or id.
