Small project to learn about topics that intrest me.
Pokedex is a project where I use sqlite to make a database where
it contains information on all known Pokemon.

The first part is to use sqlite and C++ to create a database and be able to create a table,
and insert and select from that table. 

The second part is to use Python to create a web scraper to get information from Bulbapedia,
an online wiki of Pokemon, and use that to populate the database.

Lastly, I would like to be able to make it so a user can query the Pokedex to search information
on Pokemon they are intrested in by providing information such as name, type, or id. This is done by using Python Flask.

I also used HTML and CSS to try and make a front-end site where I can allow users to query the database on a website.
