Small project to learn about topics that intrest me.
Pokedex is a project where I use sqlite to make a database where
it contains information on all known Pokemon.

The first part is to use sqlite and C++ to create a database and be able to create a table,
and insert and select from that table. 

The second part is to use Perl (subject to change) to get information from Bulbapedia,
an online wiki of Pokemon, and use that to populate the database.

Lastly, I would like to be able to make it so a user can query the Pokedex to search information
on Pokemon they are intrested in by providing information such as name, type, or id.

Currently, Part 1 where I set up the database is complete.
