			<p>Due to the great success of Pokémon in the international market, the release of Pokémon
				Gold and Silver was greatly awaited. Taking place in the fictional region of Johto,
				players could choose from three new starting Pokémon: Chikorita, Cyndaquil, or Totodile.
				In the Johto, there are many new Pokémon to discover as well as a new bunch of Gym Leaders.
				Many new features were also added such as the ability to breed Pokémon, a time system, and 
				two new types: Steel and Dark. In addition, after beating the game the first time, the player
				has the ability to access the Kanto region and challenge the Gym Leaders from Red and Blue
				with slight differences. Also, a special area called Silver Cave is also unlocked wherein
				the player can challenge Red, the protagonist of Red and Blue.

			<p>Following the blueprint of the first generation of Pokémon games, Pokémon Crystal was releashed a 
				few years after Gold and Silver. Much like Pokémon Yellow, it followered the main plotline
				of it's predecessors but added in enough new features to be considered a standalone game. Though, in Crystal
				the lengendary Pokémon Suicune was given a bigger role in the main story as well as a new character named Eusine. 
				One of the features added was the choice of picking between either playing as a boy or as a girl.
				All subsequent games also added in this gender choice. Some other features added in were animated sprites
				, though only the front was animated. This animation was not seen again until Pokémon Emerald. The first Battle Tower
				was also introduced in Crystal. The Battle Tower has special rules that the player had to follow during battle.
				Pokémon Crystal introduced many features that continue to be used in Pokémon games today.
